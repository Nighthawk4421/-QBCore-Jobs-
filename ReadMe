For the construction job: You must change the vehicles that spawn inside the client file. The ones I used were paid for from patreon.com/baggedcustoms and are not available for reupload. If you want those vehicles feel free to visit Bagged Custom's patreon at patreon.com/baggedcustoms


The white widow has some issues with the UI side. This is due to the fact that I have limited experience with JavaScript so I still struggle heavily with this. Comments and helpful constructive criticism are welcome! Please no disparaging comments or remarks. Positive vibes fams <3
